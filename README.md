# RPS-Multiplayer

## Function

When user loads the page, if there are less than two players in game, initiates user to be a player. If there are two players already, prevent other users to play or input anything on page (essentially other users are observers of the current match). The two players will then choose rock, paper, or scissors. When both players have chosen what to play then compare the plays and update win/loss/tie accordingly to both players. When user wishes to leave the game, press sign-out to allow new users to join the game.

## Notes

I'm trying to understand how firebase work use the database to store information that will allow me to limit number of players. Struggling to figure out how to utilize database to let the javascript run seamlessly while having two users simultaneously input info. I am unable to complete the assignment but I've done as much pseudo-code as possible though some steps may have to be changed to have the game work properly. 

## Things to work on

* Understand the methods in firebase and the relationship between database and authenticating users
* Utilize database to keep data to allow two players to simultaneously input choices and messages
* Work on transitions when new players join and when players leave
* Aesthetics of the website
* Allow players to change their names in game
* Add sign-in for users that wishes keep their record permanently
